# S.F.-City-Survey-Dashboard

The data is from the San Francisco City Survey available on Data.gov.

Survey respondents gave ratings from 1 to 5 to indicate their satisfaction with city services like the library system. Demographic data such as age, education, and language was collected.

I built a Tableau dashboard to (figuratively) help the library marketing team understand their audience. The goal was to provide a clear, measurable picture of the audience to inform event planning at the library.
